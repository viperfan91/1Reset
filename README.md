Reset your 1Password back to a fresh install

======

I wrote this AppleScript based program after having to manually remove all of the files on all of my computers.
Plus, it's just a good learning experience. :)

Words of Advice:
----------------

1. Make sure you know what you're doing. This program does have options to PERMANENTLY remove files from iCloud and Dropbox.
2. Quit 1Password and the 1Password Helper on the computer before running this program.
3. If you plan on resetting iCloud and/or Dropbox make sure to repeat #2 on all computers/devices running 1Password.
